## What did you do the past week?
Since the class just began, I did not do much. It was nice learning about Docker since this is something I used in my internship this past summer.

## What's in your way?

## What will you do next week?

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
