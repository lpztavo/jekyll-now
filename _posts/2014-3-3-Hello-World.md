## What did you do the past week?
Since the class just began, I did not do much. It was nice learning about Docker since this is something I used in my internship this past summer.

## What's in your way?
I am still feeling a bit sluggish in getting back into school mode. I also am not sure if I will be staying in this class since I am on a waitlist for a different CS class. I still want to take this class in the spring, but I just feel like I should be focusing on recruiting this semester since I am a senior.

## What will you do next week?
Next week I plan on getting project 1 out of the way if I am still enrolled in the class. This should not be too bad since I have taken OOP and the first project is identical but just in a different language.
